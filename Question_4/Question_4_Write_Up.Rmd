# Introduction {-}

In this report I will investigate the claim that the USA's billionaires are made up of a larger proportion of self-made billionaires, than is seen in the rest of the world. I will conduct this analysis via a waffle chart.


# Self-Made Billionaires {-}

The waffle plot below illustrates the proportion of billionaires that are self-made for both the USA and the rest of the world.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "output/waffle_plot.png")
```

The waffle plot illustrates that the United States has indeed had a growth in the proportion of their billionaires being self-made. In 1996 the proportion of self-made billionaires in the rest of the world was larger than the proportion of self-made billionaires in the United States, but by 2001 the United States had already reversed this trend and it has been maintained up until 2014.
